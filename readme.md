# Landlord - Ruby Enums edition!

OH NOES, A up and coming property manager, Bob Pizza has too much data now and is having trouble managing it all. He wants US to build him a sick new app. But before he just pays us money he wants to see our chops with ruby enumerables...

## Part 1 Practice With enumerables
Read the comments in `app.rb` to follow the directions practicing enumerables
> Store the enumerable methods into variables and use `puts` to verify the results of your methods

## Part 2 Build the App
> Comment out any functional code in app.rb, but save it, you can leverage the code from Part 1 to write out parts of this application.

Bob Pizza is old school, and he wants a sick command line interface for this app. Bob's user stories:

### MVP:
```
- I should have a numbered interface for my application so that I can just type in a number to access different parts of my program.
- I should be allowed an option to view all the apartments so that I can get an overview of my properties.
- I should be allowed  an option view all the tenants so that I can get an overview of my tenants
```

### Silver:
```
- I should be allowed an option to view all the apartments with their tenants so that I can get an overview of Occupancy.
- I should be able to find where a tenant lives based on tenant name in case of emergencies.
```

### Gold:
```
- I should be allowed to remove a tenant from an apartment so that I can track evictions/lease ends
- I should be allowed to add a tenant to an apartment so that I can track occupancy.
- I should be allowed to create a new apartment so that I can track new properties in my books
- I should be allowed to create a new tenant so that I can track new tenants in my books.
```
